        Sealed concrete is a popular choice for driveways, patios, and walkways in San Bernardino, offering durability and a sleek appearance.
        However, the region’s climate, with its hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, can impact the longevity of sealed concrete.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Sweep and Rinse:</strong> Start by sweeping away debris, leaves, and dirt that accumulated over winter. 
          Follow with a gentle rinse using a garden hose to remove any remaining dust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mild Detergent Cleaning:</strong> For more stubborn stains or dirt, use a mild detergent mixed with water. 
          Scrub the surface lightly with a soft-bristle brush, avoiding any abrasive cleaners that could damage the sealant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inspect for Damage:</strong> Look for any signs of wear or damage to the sealant, such as dull spots or small cracks. 
          Addressing these early can prevent more extensive repairs later on.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Summer Protection: Shielding Against Heat and Sun</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Reapply Sealant if Necessary:</strong> If you notice that your concrete has lost its luster or is more susceptible to staining, it might be time to reapply the sealant. 
          Choose a high-quality, UV-resistant sealant to protect against sun damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water Wisely:</strong> Avoid excessive water exposure during the hottest parts of the day. Watering nearby plants or washing down your concrete is best done in the early morning or late evening to prevent evaporation and potential water spots.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fall Maintenance: Preparing for Cooler Temperatures</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Leaf Removal:</strong> Fallen leaves can stain sealed concrete if left to decompose. Regularly sweep your surfaces to keep them free of organic debris.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check for Sealant Wear:</strong> Fall is a good time to inspect your sealant’s condition. If the surface feels rough or the water no longer beads up, consider applying a fresh coat before winter sets in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gutter Maintenance:</strong> Ensure that gutters and downspouts are clean and functioning properly to prevent water from pooling on your concrete, which can lead to staining or erosion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Winter Care: Managing Moisture and Mildew</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Prevent Water Pooling:</strong> Keep an eye on areas where water tends to pool after rain. If necessary, adjust the slope of your concrete to improve drainage or consider adding a French drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid De-Icing Chemicals:</strong> If you need to manage ice, avoid using harsh de-icing chemicals that can degrade the sealant. Sand or kitty litter can provide traction without causing damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Even in winter, it’s important to keep your sealed concrete clean to prevent mildew or mold growth, especially in shaded areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

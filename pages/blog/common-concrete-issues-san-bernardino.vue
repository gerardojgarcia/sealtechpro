        Common Concrete Issues in San Bernardino
      </h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Cracking</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Temperature Fluctuations: The significant temperature changes between
          day and night cause the concrete to expand and contract, leading to
          cracks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drying Shrinkage: Rapid evaporation of moisture from the concrete
          surface during the hot, dry summer months can result in shrinkage
          cracks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Control Joints: Incorporate control joints during construction to
          manage the location of cracks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible Sealants: Use polyurethane or silicone sealants that can
          accommodate the movement caused by temperature changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper Curing: Ensure adequate curing time and conditions to reduce
          shrinkage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Spalling</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Freeze-Thaw Cycles: Although rare in San Bernardino, occasional
          freeze-thaw cycles can cause surface flaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deicing Chemicals: The use of deicing salts in winter can lead to
          surface deterioration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Surface Sealers: Apply penetrating sealers that protect against
          freeze-thaw damage and chemical exposure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper Drainage: Ensure adequate drainage to prevent water from
          pooling on the concrete surface.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. Discoloration</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Inconsistent Mixing: Variations in the concrete mix can lead to uneven
          color.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weather Conditions: Exposure to sun, rain, and pollutants can cause
          staining and discoloration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Uniform Mixing: Ensure consistent mixing and application of the
          concrete.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stains and Dyes: Use high-quality concrete stains and dyes to achieve
          a uniform color.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protective Coatings: Apply UV-resistant sealers to protect against sun
          damage and discoloration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">4. Scaling</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Poor Finishing: Improper finishing techniques can lead to a weak
          surface layer that is prone to scaling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Harsh Weather: Exposure to extreme weather conditions can exacerbate
          scaling.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          High-Quality Sealants: Use acrylic or epoxy sealants to create a
          durable, protective layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper Finishing Techniques: Employ skilled professionals to ensure
          correct finishing practices.

        <p class="text-gray-700">Sealing concrete surfaces is crucial for enhancing durability, appearance, and longevity, especially in areas like San Bernardino, where the weather can be tough on untreated surfaces. However, before applying a sealer, proper preparation is key. Without it, even the best sealants can fail, leading to costly repairs and diminished aesthetic appeal.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Understanding San Bernardino’s Climate Impact on Concrete</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">San Bernardino’s hot, dry summers and occasional winter rains can take a toll on concrete surfaces. The high temperatures cause concrete to expand, while cooler nights lead to contraction. Over time, this can result in cracks, surface wear, and exposure to the elements. Properly preparing your concrete before sealing is essential to help it withstand these climate challenges.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Step 1: Thorough Cleaning</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Before sealing, concrete surfaces must be clean and free of debris, stains, or any existing sealers. Here’s how to do it:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Sweep and Remove Debris: Begin by sweeping the surface to clear away dirt, leaves, and other debris.</li>
          <li>Power Wash: Use a pressure washer to remove embedded dirt, stains, and old sealer. A power wash also helps to open up the pores of the concrete for better sealer penetration.</li>
          <li>Stain Removal: Treat any oil, grease, or rust stains with appropriate cleaning agents. Consider using a degreaser or a concrete-specific cleaner for stubborn stains.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Step 2: Repairing Surface Damage</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Concrete surfaces often suffer from cracks, chips, or spalling, particularly in areas with fluctuating temperatures. Repairing these issues before sealing is crucial for a smooth, uniform finish.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Crack Filling: Use a concrete crack filler to repair any visible cracks. Ensure the filler is compatible with the type of sealer you plan to use.</li>
          <li>Patching Spalled Areas: For larger areas of damage, a concrete patching compound may be necessary. Smooth out patched areas so they blend seamlessly with the rest of the surface.</li>
          <li>Surface Grinding: If your concrete has uneven surfaces or is heavily stained, consider grinding it down to create a uniform, clean surface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Step 3: Ensuring Proper Drying</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">San Bernardino’s dry heat can be both an advantage and a challenge when preparing concrete for sealing.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Allow Time to Dry: After cleaning and repairs, the concrete must be completely dry before applying any sealer. This may take 24-48 hours, depending on the weather and thickness of the concrete.</li>
          <li>Check for Moisture: Use a moisture meter to ensure the surface is dry. Moisture trapped under a sealer can lead to cloudiness or sealant failure.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Step 4: Applying a Primer (Optional)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">For certain sealants, especially those used on previously untreated or highly porous concrete, applying a primer can enhance adhesion and coverage.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Choose the Right Primer: Ensure the primer is compatible with your chosen sealer. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and drying times.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Step 5: Sealing the Concrete</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Once your concrete is properly prepared, it’s time to apply the sealer.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Select the Right Sealer: Consider factors like UV resistance, water repellency, and slip resistance when choosing a sealer for San Bernardino’s climate.</li>
          <li>Application Method: Use a roller, sprayer, or brush to apply the sealer evenly. Avoid over-application, as this can lead to a blotchy finish or prolonged drying times.</li>
          <li>Cure Time: Allow the sealer to cure as per the manufacturer's recommendations before exposing the surface to traffic or moisture.</li>
        </ul>
